# bt3-dp-team-gen
For full disclosure, in spite of what my name says, this is NOT a modding tool.

It's more or less a simple Java project made in Eclipse, which returns a randomly generated team once the user specifies the DP Limit (maximum total score of the team) and the number of characters/teammates for both teams.

Special Thanks to [jagger1407](https://github.com/jagger1407) for providing feedback and much-needed suggestions.

## Usage/Preview
![preview1](https://github.com/ViveTheModder/bt3-dp-team-generator/blob/main/img/demo.png)

## Known Issues
* As of now, this program is command-line only.
* I cannot get a proper runnable JAR release of the program because of certain issues with Eclipse's export feature.
  Because of that, there are no download/build instructions provided. Guilty as charged.
* This program is a work-in-progress, and it does NOT take into consideration which characters are repeatable or not, as well as Budokai Tenkaichi 3's transformation restriction system in general.
